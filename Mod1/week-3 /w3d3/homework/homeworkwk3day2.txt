How Super Mario Mastered Level Design - 5:42


Discuss - How does this apply to web development?

Super Mario game has an example of how web development can be applied in a game. From what I understood, the designer made sure that the game was intuitive as well as fun to play with. The game shows colors and figures that catch the players'attention. We can see that this game was carefully designed from beginning to end.

Discuss - How does this apply to web development?

I believe the video presenter has a point in saying that bad design can be misleading.
A designer must able to create a product that is easy to use no the opposite. In web development, we apply the same concepts. A product that is designed poorly can cause frustration to the users and ruin the builder's reputation.
In the case of web development, a program that is hard to maneuver or does not have any instructions can distract users and ultimately disappear from the market. I like the concepts of the designer Don Norman. He mentioned some important stages of the design of a product, discoverability, exploration and testing.

What's a site that you use all the time that has good UX?
How is that site:
Goal Focused
Invisible
Forgiving
Consistent
Smooth Onboarding



I use different sites and search engines. I personally like google because it gives you too many choices. It is clear and easy to maneuver. It is very consistent and it has a simple and powerful UI. For web browser I use Firefox and Chrome. Both of them are simple and do the job.

We're going to create the game tic-tac-toe ... but before we begin, what are some user stories that we'll want to make sure we cover?

üêò Reminder - Write from the perspective of the user: "As a user I want to be able to click on x and have y happen" or ‚ÄúAs a ____, I need a ____ in order to ____‚Äù.

Share your user stories in the tech-talk channel as you write them!

I will start with breaking the program into parts:
1- I will create functions that can perform what the user wants. I will create specifics taks
   A)Ask the user to click on any box to start the game.
   B)When the user clicks on the box, the box or will change into another color.
   C)I will display a message to the user, let him / her know that only has 1 try.
   C)And, finally display the loser or winner at the end of the game.


2- The game will use conditional statements to determine the next player's move.
For example:
if (condition)
{
  if the player already select this box and this position, I want to perform this...
}
else
{
  if the player does not perform this, I want to this.
}

3- I will use for loops to iterate through the conditions

A for loop will check if the user already completed certains talks and if the player completed the goal, then do this..

for ( action = 0, action < completeTask; action)


4- The game will also contain objects to store the numbers.
Example:
const select =
 {
    property:left,
    Property: right,
}
   

These instructions seem to be very simple but they are very clear. The user will know what to do when they click on the game.
