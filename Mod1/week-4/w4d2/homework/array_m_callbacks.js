/*Section 3 Array Methods with Callbacks
A few array methods use callbacks. For example .map - .map takes each element of an array and does something to it
 and returns a new arrays.But what should it do? Multiply everything by 5? Capitalize everything?
If .map had a hard-coded thing it always did with an array, it wouldn't be very flexible. By allowing a callback to determine 
what happens to each array element we get a lot of flexibility and we can do some really powerful things. */
